```

```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```

## Prerequisites

You need git to clone the `Generala2` repository. You can get git from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and test `Generala2`. You must have Node.js
and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Clone `Generala2`

## Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`http://localhost:4200/`][local-app-url].
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Or you can use:

```
npm run serve
```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Or you can use:

```
npm run build
```

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
